## Bioreactor Data Analysis

### Background

In a bioprocess engineering lab, several bioreactor runs were performed to study the effect of different feed types on process performance. Two datasets were collected:

1.  **Bioreactor Readings**\
    This dataset (`bioreactor_readings.csv`) contains time-series measurements recorded during each run. It is provided in a wide format with columns for the run number, time (in hours), and various sensor readings:

    -   `Run`: Identifier for the bioreactor run.

    -   `Time`: Time stamp (hours).

    -   `Temp`: Temperature (°C).

    -   `pH`: pH level.

    -   `DO`: Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L).

    -   `Substrate`: Substrate concentration (g/L).

2.  **Experimental Metadata**\
    This dataset (`experiment_info.csv`) contains metadata about each run:

    -   `Run`: Run identifier (matching the bioreactor dataset).

    -   `Feed`: Type of feed (e.g., “Glucose”, “Glycerol”).

    -   `Inoculum`: Inoculum concentration (OD units).

    -   `Operator`: Name of the operator in charge.

### Tasks

#### 1. Import and Inspect the Data

    -   Load both CSV files into R as data frames.

    -   Use the `head()` function (or similar) to inspect the first few rows of each dataset.

```{r}    
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Import data
bioreactor <-
  read_csv("data/bioreactor_readings.csv")
experiment <-
  read_csv("data/experiment_info.csv")

head(bioreactor)
head(experiment)

```

#### 2. Data Tidying (Pivoting)

    -   **Pivot Longer:**\
        Convert the bioreactor readings from wide format into a long (tidy) format so that all measurements (Temp, pH, DO, Substrate) are in a single column named `Parameter` with corresponding values in a column named `Value`.\
        *Hint: Use `tidyr::pivot_longer()`.*

    -   **Pivot Wider:**\
        After some analysis, you decide to reshape the long dataset back into a wide format, but now grouping by `Run` and `Time` such that each parameter becomes its own column again.\
        *Hint: Use `tidyr::pivot_wider()`.*
        
```{r}
# 2. Pivot longer: Tidy the bioreactor data
bioreactor_long <- bioreactor %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = Temp:Substrate, 
               names_to = "Parameter", 
               values_to = "Value")

# This would allow us to plot both parameters on the same plot

ggplot(data = bioreactor_long, 
       mapping = aes(x = Time, 
                     y = Value, 
                     color = Parameter, 
                     linetype = as.factor(Run))) + 
  geom_line()
```

#### 2b. Pivot wider: Reshape back to wide format if needed
```{r}
bioreactor_wide <- bioreactor_long %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Parameter, values_from = Value)

```


#### 3. Joining Datasets

    -   Merge the reshaped bioreactor dataset with the experimental metadata using the common `Run` column.\
        *Hint: Use one of the join functions (e.g., `dplyr::left_join()`).*
        
```{r}
# 3. Join datasets by 'Run'
merged_data <- bioreactor_wide %>%
  left_join(experiment, by = "Run")

```


#### 4. Grouping and Summarizing

    -   Group the merged dataset by the `Feed` type.

    -   Calculate summary statistics (e.g., mean and standard deviation, or min and max) for key measurements such as `Temp`, `pH`, and `Substrate` across all time points and runs for each feed type.\
        *Hint: Use `dplyr::group_by()` and `dplyr::summarize()`.*

```{r}
# 4. Group and summarize by 'Feed'
summary_stats <- merged_data %>%
  group_by(Feed) %>%
  summarize(mean_Temp = mean(Temp, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_Temp   = sd(Temp, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_pH   = mean(pH, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_pH     = sd(pH, na.rm = TRUE), 
            max_Subs  = max(Substrate, na.rm = TRUE), 
            min_Subs  = min(Substrate, na.rm = TRUE))

# View summary statistics
print(summary_stats)
```


5.  **Interpreting the Results**

    -   Discuss how different feed types glucose vs glycerol may be affecting the reactor conditions based on your summary statistics.

    -   What potential insights could an engineer draw from these analyses?


## Root Growth Inhibition Example

### Introduction

In my research group we study plant genes and how they function. One interesting thing about plants is that their genomes are quite large compared to other organisms and one of the reasons for that is their genomes have been duplicated several times throughout the history of their evolution

![gnome duplication](data/Largest-collection-of-garden-gnomes-60at60-photo2_tcm25-386214.webp)

These genome duplications have generated families of genes which have similar but slightly different functions. Often we think about each of these genes in a family as playing a distinct role, and by **adding** together their function we could approximate their total function. However that's not always the case because these genes might interact with one another—directly through binding or indirectly through competition—to perform their total function. These interactions might cause some deviation from our **additive** model of function; in genetics this is called **epistasis**.

This dataset is from [Prigge *et al*. 2020](), who collected measurements of several phenotypes for combinations of mutants in the TIR1/AFB auxin receptor genes which my group studies and engineers.

### Read in data 

```{r}
root_growth_inh_0 <- read_xlsx("data/elife-54740-fig1-figsupp3-data1-v2_data-only_tir1afb1.xlsx", sheet = "Primary Root Growth Inh EtOH", skip = 1)
root_growth_inh_20 <- read_xlsx("data/elife-54740-fig1-figsupp3-data1-v2_data-only_tir1afb1.xlsx", sheet = "Primary Root Growth Inh 20 nM", skip = 1)
root_growth_inh_100 <- read_xlsx("data/elife-54740-fig1-figsupp3-data1-v2_data-only_tir1afb1.xlsx", sheet = "Primary Root Growth Inh 100 nM", skip = 1)
root_growth_inh_500 <- read_xlsx("data/elife-54740-fig1-figsupp3-data1-v2_data-only_tir1afb1.xlsx", sheet = "Primary Root Growth Inh 500 nM", skip = 1)
```

### Write a function for tidying this data

```{r}
root_growth_plonger <- function(data){
  data |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = -line, 
               names_to = "genotype", 
               values_to = "root_growth_mm") %>%
  mutate(batch = str_extract(genotype, "\\s(.*)$")) %>%
  mutate(batch = str_remove_all(batch, "\\s")) %>%
  mutate(genotype = str_remove(genotype, "\\s.*")) %>%
  mutate(batch = if_else(is.na(batch), "a", batch)) %>%
  na.omit()
}
```

### Tidy the individual datasets

```{r}
root_growth_inh_0 <- root_growth_plonger(root_growth_inh_0)
root_growth_inh_0$treatment <- 0

root_growth_inh_20 <- root_growth_plonger(root_growth_inh_20)
root_growth_inh_20$treatment <- 20

root_growth_inh_100 <- root_growth_plonger(root_growth_inh_100)
root_growth_inh_100$treatment <- 100

root_growth_inh_500 <- root_growth_plonger(root_growth_inh_500)
root_growth_inh_500$treatment <- 500

root_growth_inh <- bind_rows(root_growth_inh_0, 
                             root_growth_inh_20, 
                             root_growth_inh_100, 
                             root_growth_inh_500)

root_growth_inh %>% group_by(batch) %>% 
  mutate(percent_inh = root_growth_mm / 
           mean(root_growth_mm[genotype == "Col-0" & treatment == 0]) * 100) ->
  root_growth_inh
```

```{r}
root_growth_inh_aov <- aov(percent_inh ~ genotype*treatment + batch, data = root_growth_inh)
summary(root_growth_inh_aov)

root_growth_inh$fac_treat <- as.factor(root_growth_inh$treatment)
root_growth_inh_aov <- aov(percent_inh ~ genotype*fac_treat + batch, data = root_growth_inh)
summary(root_growth_inh_aov)
root_growth_inh_aov.HSD <- broom::tidy(TukeyHSD(root_growth_inh_aov))
root_growth_inh_aov.HSD[which(root_growth_inh_aov.HSD$adj.p.value < 0.05),]
```

Looks like there are no strong batch effects here.

```{r}
root_growth_inh %>% filter(genotype != "tir1-10") %>%
  filter(treatment %in% c(0,100)) %>%
  mutate(TIR1 = !str_detect(genotype, "tir1"), 
                            AFB1 = !str_detect(genotype, "afb1")) ->
  root_growth_inh
```

For now let's look at the whole dataset.

```{r}
root_growth_inh.int <- aov(percent_inh ~ TIR1*AFB1*treatment, data = root_growth_inh)
summary(root_growth_inh.int)
```

```{r}
root_growth_inh.int <- aov(percent_inh ~ TIR1*AFB1*fac_treat, data = root_growth_inh)
summary(root_growth_inh.int)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = root_growth_inh, aes(x = fac_treat, y = percent_inh, color = genotype)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.2))
```

Strong case for an interaction, but not dependent on treatment, interesting.

To make this easier to explain we can repeat this analysis after stratifying by treatment.

```{r}
root_growth_inh0.int <- aov(percent_inh ~ TIR1*AFB1, data = filter(root_growth_inh, treatment == 0))
summary(root_growth_inh0.int)
```

This matches expectations mostly, I would have expected AFB1 to have less effect, but in this model the double mutant is also contributing to this effect size. The interaction here is still a strong effect. 100 nM should be more telling even.

```{r}
root_growth_inh100.int <- aov(percent_inh ~ TIR1*AFB1, data = filter(root_growth_inh, treatment == 100))
summary(root_growth_inh100.int)
```

Very interesting, TIR1 has a very strong effect as expected at this high auxin concentration, whereas AFB1 does not, but the interaction term is significant at both 0 nM and 100 nM IAA.
