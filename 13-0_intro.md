This week, we will be focusing on Systems of Equations in R. Please review the following readings to refresh your linear algebra skills. 

## This week's prep:
(Also found on Week 13 Canvas page)

### Required reading:

1. Primer - Linear Algebra can be performed easily by computers, but we need to remind ourselves of how to set up problems as a set of matrices before we can so    <https://drive.google.com/file/d/132NvRrMVbBYNex5iNhoeBwC1ck5MZMAB/view?usp=sharing> 

2. Matrix Algebra Overview - basics, notation, refresher on matrix multiplication, using inverse (e.g. eq 8.7), and converting equations to matrix form (section 8.1.3)
