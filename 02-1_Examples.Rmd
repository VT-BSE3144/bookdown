# The R Language and Tidy Data Examples {-}


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load packages 
library(tidyverse)
```

## Tidy Data

Each of the following datasets shows TB cases and some other variables per country organized in different ways.

```{r}
table1

table2

table3

# Spread across two tibbles
table4a  # cases

table4b  # population
```

There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

-   Each variable must have its own column.
-   Each observation must have its own row.
-   Each value must have its own cell.

**Which table above is Tidy?**

```{r}
table1

table2

table3

# Spread across two tibbles
table4a  # cases

table4b  # population
```

Why ensure that your data is tidy? There are two main advantages:

There’s a general advantage to picking one consistent way of storing data. If you have a consistent data structure, it’s easier to learn the tools that work with it because they have an underlying uniformity.

There’s a specific advantage to placing variables in columns because it allows R’s vectorised nature to shine. As you learned in mutate and summary functions, most built-in R functions work with vectors of values. That makes transforming tidy data feel particularly natural.

### Let's make a data dictionary for this dataset

`country` = The country in which TB case data was reported. `year` = Calendar year `cases` = Test-positive cases with culture-based and ELISA-based tests in these countries with sample dates within the year above. `population` = The self-reported population of each country according to their census data.

## R Basics

### Data types

You can create objects (variables\~values, large data structures\~think spreadsheets and databases, and functions) using the `=`, `<-` or `->` operators. You can see what type of data (or data type) a variable is using the `class` function. Go ahead, try `class(x)`. Data in R can be of several different, basic types:

| Data Type | aka         | Example                             |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| Logical   | Boolean     | TRUE, FALSE                         |
| Numeric   | float       | 42, 3.14,                           |
| Character | string      | 'a' , "good", "TRUE", '23.4'        |
| Integer   |             | 2L, 34L, 0L                         |
| Complex   |             | 3 + 2i                              |
| Raw       | hexadecimal | "Hello" is stored as 48 65 6c 6c 6f |

### Functions

What is a function?

`function_name(argument_name = argument_value)`

Using Tab-complete to make function calls will prevent errors!


### Objects

An object is essentially anything that shows up in the Environment pane!

- functions
- variables
- data objects

### Vectors

To demonstrate what a vector is let's load some data!

## Data, tibbles, dataframes


### Reading in data


```{r}
library(readxl)
storm <- read_excel(path = "data/hazards.xlsx", sheet = 2)
storm
```

Each column is a vector!

```{r}
# check whether something is a vector with is.vector()


# but some vectors are special like dates with formatting


```



```{r}
# use head(), summary(), or view() to look at data

```


### Factors

Factors are categorical variables.

```{r}
# look at a factor variable

# can you add new values to factors? 

```



How would we check that a variable only contains certain values?

```{r}
storm$monthly.ppt > 7

```
